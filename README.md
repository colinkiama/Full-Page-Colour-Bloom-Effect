# Full-Page-Colour-Bloom-Effect
Animates the whole page with a color changing animations using the windows.ui.compositon APIs
If you want to know more about windows.ui.composition, check out the repo for it here: https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs

If you want to contribute, a great place to start would be the projects tab, there you can see different ways you can make this great and the roadmap for the repo in the long term 

This is also a great way to learn about how the colour bloom effect works since the methods and UI used in Microsoft example were a bit
all over the place. This is much easier to understand and use (especially with my own comments added too!).

There is a bug I've discovered while using this effect. The ordeer that the colours are supposed to show get messed up because
of it. I've added some fixes to it but if you still encounter the bug, feel free to help me fix it.
